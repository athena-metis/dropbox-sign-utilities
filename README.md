This repository contains code for a Chrome/Chromium/Edge extension that injects additional functionality into the HelloSign / DropboxSign site. Specifically it adds the ability to download "Bulk send" CSV reports for a batch of bulk send jobs identified by date range or where the document subject starts with a specific string.


This extension also changes the default CSV format of one row per custom field to having one row per signer with custom fields represented as columns.


This was created for a specific use case but may be useful to others either as a starting point for your own customisation or as-is.
